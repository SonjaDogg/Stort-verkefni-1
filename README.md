# STÓRT VERKEFNI 1

## GENERAL INFORMATION

The exercise consists on a web with three pages and with the principles of responsive web design in mind.
To view the exercise it is only necessary to open in browser the files index.html, um.html and form.html that are contained in the folder of the project: stort-verkefni-1.

## GENERAL ORGANISATION OF THE PROJECT

The exercise has four html files, one for each page. These are:

* index.html      - front page of the project
* um.html         - about page
* form.html       - form page
* elements.html   - elements page with examples of the features that can be found on the other three pages

Each html file refers to the css files:

* grid.css        
* styleguide.css
* styles.css

To construct the css files several scss files have been used. The reason for this is to have a much cleaner and more structured organisation of the css in project. All the scss files are written using SASS and translated using node-sass tool from the package manager npm.
The scss files in the project are:

* styles.scss     - contains all the styles for the project
* button.scss     - styles for the buttons on all .html pages
* card.scss       - styles for the cards on index.html
* cardlist.scss   - styles for the cardlist on index.html
* field.scss      - styles for input fields on form.html
* footer.scss     - styles for the footer on all .html pages
* grid.scss       - styles for the grid on all .html pages
* header.scss     - styles for the header on all .html pages
* heading.scss    - styles for the headings on all .html pages
* perk.scss       - styles for index.html
* text.scss       - styles for all text on all .html pages
