## GENERAL INFORMATION

The exercise consists on a web with three pages and with the principles of responsive web design in mind.
To view the exercise it is only necessary to open in browser the files index.html, um.html and form.html that are contain in the folder of the project: stort-verkefni-1.

## GENERAL ORGANISATION OF THE PROJECT

The exercise has three html files, one for each page. These are:
* index.html
* um.html
* form.html

Each html file refers to the css files:
* grid.css        
* styleguide.css
* styles.css

To construct the css files several scss files have been used. The reason for this is to have a much cleaner and more structured organisation of css of the project. All the scss files are written using SASS and translated using node-sass tool from the package manager npm.
The scss files in the project are:  
* styles.scss   
* button.scss   
* card.scss
* cardlist.scss
* field.scss
* footer.scss
* footer2.scss
* grid.scss
* header.scss
* heading.scss
* perk.scss
* text.scss
